> It happened February 22! Itâ€™s the biggest release Valentine's day popup dinner between Penn, Princeton, and Yale! Come single and excited to make friends, or maybe an even closer someone! Having a Latin American themed dinner with tapas, seafood, and a comfy environment, it's definitely something you'd enjoy :)
